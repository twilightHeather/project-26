HOW TO MAKE THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE RECIPE EVER (HOW TO MAKE EASY COOKIES FROM SCRATCH)
Like I said, these cookies are crazy easy, however here are a few notes.

Soften butter. If you are planning on making these, take the butter out of the fridge first thing in the morning so it’s ready to go when you need it.
Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). There has been some controversy on how to measure flour. I personally use the scoop and shake method and always have (gasp)! It’s easier and I have never had that method fail me.  Many of you say that the only way to measure flour is to scoop it into the measuring cup and level with a knife. I say, measure it the way you always do. Just make sure that the dough matches the consistency of the dough in the photos in this post. 
Use LOTS of chocolate chips. Do I really need to explain this?!
DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! I explain this more below, but these chocolate chip cookies will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.
HOW DO YOU FREEZE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH (FREEZER-FRIENDLY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES)
Freezer-friendly. I always make a full batch of these cookies, roll them into balls, and freeze what we don’t bake right away.

How to bake frozen dough – thawing it first: I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for impromptu guests. When you want to bake them, simple remove the dough balls from the freezer, set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw.

Once they reach room temperature (after about 1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen) bake as directed in the recipe. SO easy!

CAN YOU BAKE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH FROM FROZEN? 
I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can even count. I have gotten the best results when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet.

Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.
